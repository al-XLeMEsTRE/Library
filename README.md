# Project 1: Triple Peaks Library

Welcome to the Triple Peaks Library project, a cornerstone creation from my journey through TripleTen's Software Engineer program. This website is crafted to epitomize the harmony of form and function, grounded in the principles of web development.

## Project Overview

Using HTML and CSS, I've transformed a given design brief into a live, interactive library webpage. This site not only provides an elegant user interface but also serves as a practical tool for book enthusiasts to explore and utilize library resources.

## Core Features

- **Semantic HTML5**: Utilizing HTML5 to structure content meaningfully, enhancing accessibility and search engine rankings.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Implementing Flexbox for a fluid, responsive layout that gracefully adjusts to display across various devices.
- **Positioning**: Mastering CSS positioning to place elements in complex layouts without compromising the design.
- **Z-Index Stacking**: Managing the stacking order of elements with z-index, creating an intuitive visual hierarchy.

## Ongoing Enhancements

- **Responsive Design**: Revamping the layout to ensure the site's responsiveness for optimal viewing on any device.
- **CSS Animations**: Injecting life into the interface with subtle animations, elevating the user's visual journey.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Currently enriching the site with interactive JavaScript features to engage users and enhance functionality.

Stay tuned as the Triple Peaks Library webpage evolves with these upcoming updates!
